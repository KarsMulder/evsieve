So, in short, while it shouldn't be a problem to use the data in it, it is unclear whether the file HidUsageTables.json
is allowed to be redistributed verbatim. Therefore, it has not been checked into this git repository. To obtain a copy
of it, visit https://usb.org/document-library/hid-usage-tables-15, download from that page download "hut1_5.pdf",
open it with your favourite PDF reader, then extract the attachment called "HidUsageTables.json" and put it in this
folder with the same name "HidUsageTables.json".

At the time of writing, the SHA-256 hash of the file HidUsageTables.json version 1.5 should be:
    127ebe3c81a8c82f5541a833200de562558add95c423363dc0e9a795bb70b418
