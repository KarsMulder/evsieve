# The following "license = " key includes licenses from some dependencies, even if no code
# from those dependencies is on this repository. See the COPYING file for more detailed information.
#
# Most of this program is (compatible with) GPL-2.0-or-later, but I'm not a lawyer and
# I am unable to determine whether or not this program is legally a derivative work of the
# Linux kernel, so I'm marking the license conservatively in Cargo.toml. If you wish to
# redistribute this program under GPLv3+, you should do your own legal research on whether
# that is possible.
